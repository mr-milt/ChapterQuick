Remove recap from previus chapter by comparing imges and remove dublicates. if posibal do it in front end if not backend. Curently therse no backend. 
Add a on/off "switch" for "Remove recap from previus chapter" in ChapterQuick.html and save its state in localstorage. 


Add a way to automaticly add a domain to the allowed by sending page content(html) to a backend that reads it and saves the dommain and the way it goes to next capter. it does that by checking classes/id's for the href atrubute to the next capter. then send that to client's for use.
Then content.js shuild request all allowed domains from the backend while manifest.json allows all.
for sites like webbtoons that does not use a button/spesific class for next capter but insted shows all the chapter. i will rty to come up whit a way in the future. 
My idea for now. train some type of small LLM

Add a keybindes.html and js file to allow users to chance there keybindes. they keybindes shuild be saved in local storage.
